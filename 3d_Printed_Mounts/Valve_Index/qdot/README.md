# Index Lens Mounts for EyeTrackVR

**NOTE: THESE ARE CURRENTLY ALPHA VERSIONS OF THE MODELS.**

Lenses for the Valve Index that should fit the OV2640/OV5640 cameras used by the project, as well as
friction fitting the v2 version of the emitter board.

The current version of the model is made for testing and quick iteration, therefore the cap is made
to rest at the front of the lens. Once emitter/camera position is finalized, the cap will be extended to fit over the full lens depth, to increase stability.
